# Project Types

In Visual Studio, projects are the containers that developers use to organize source code files and other resources that appear in **Solution Explorer**. 

* Typically, projects are files, for example, a .csproj file for a Visual C\# project, that store references to source code files and resources like bitmap files. 
* Projects let you organize, build, debug, and deploy source code, references to Web services and databases, and other resources. 
* Visual Studio includes several project types for languages such as C\#, Visual Basic, etc.

Visual Studio comes with many project templates to create the necessary code and files to start developing applications. The following are the most commonly used project types.

| Project Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [**Console**](console-application.md)\*\*\*\* | A **Console application** is a program designed to be used via a text-only computer interface, such as a text terminal, the command line interface, etc. |
| **MVC** |  The Model-View-Controller \(**MVC**\) is an architectural pattern that separates an **application** into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. Each of these components is built to handle specific development aspects of an **application**. |
| **WinForm** | A **Windows Forms application** is an event-driven **application** supported by Microsoft's .NET Framework. Unlike a batch program, it spends most of its time simply waiting for the user to do something, such as fill in a text box or click a button. |
| **Xamarin** | **Xamarin**.**Forms** is an open-source mobile UI framework from Microsoft for building iOS, Android, & Windows **apps** with .NET from a single shared codebase. |
| **Blazor** | **Blazor** is a free and open-source web framework that enables developers to create web apps using C\# and HTML. |
